# 2D Quasiparticle Optical Properties

The code is divided in four separate programs:

* Optabs.f90 - Calculates the RPA current-current response function.
* Sloss.f90 - Calculates the GW self-energy and the screened Coulomb interaction.
* BSE.f90 - Solves the Bethe-Salpeter equation.
* Photon.f90 - Solves the Dyson equation for the photon propagator given a response function.
